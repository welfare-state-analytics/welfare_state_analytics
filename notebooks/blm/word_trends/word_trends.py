# ### User instructions
#
# #### Load a DTM corpus
#
# To load a corpus you must first select a file, then press <b>`Load`</b>. To select the file:</b> <b>1)</b> press <b>`Change`</b> to open the file browser, <b>2)</b> find and select the file you want to open and <b>3)</b> press <b>`Change`</b> again to confirm the file and close the file browser. Then you can load the corpus by pressing <b>`Load`</b>.
#
# #### Word trends
#
# Specifiy words of interest in the text box. You can use both wildcards and regular expressions to widen your search. The
# words in the vocabulary that matches what you have specified will be listed in the selection box. Since using wildcards and regexps can result
# in a large number of words, only the `Word count` matching most frequent words are displayed. Refine your search if you get to many matches.
# The words will be plotted when they are selected. You can select and plot multiple words by pressing CTRL when selected, or using arrow keys.
#
# The regular expressions must be surrounded by vertical bars `|`. To find words ending with `tion`
# you can enter `|.*tion$|` in the textbox. I might seem cryptical, but is a very powerful notation for searching words. The vertical
# bars is specified only so that the system can distinguish the regexp from "normal" words. The actual expression is `^.*tion$`.
# The dot and star`.*` matches any character (the dot) any number of times (the `*`). The dollar sign `$` indicates the word ending.
# So this expression matches all words that begins with any number of characters follwoed, by the character sequence `tion` at the end of the word.
# To match all words starting with `info`you can enter `|^info.*|` where `^` specifies the start of the word.
