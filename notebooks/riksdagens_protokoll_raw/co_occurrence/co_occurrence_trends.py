# ### Overview
#
# This notebook implements a processing pipeline from computes word co-occurrences from plain text. The term-term co-occurrence matrix is transformed into a DTM corpus that has a vocabulary consisting of token-pairs. The co-occurring word trends can hence be xxplored using the ordinary word trends analysis tools.
#
# For large corpora the processing time can be considerable and in such a case you
# should consider using the CLI-version of the processing pipeline.

# ### How the co-occurrence counts are computed
#
# The co-occurrences are computed using a sliding window of size (D + 1 + D) that word by word moves through each document in the corpus, and keeps count of how many windows each pair of words co-occur in. Note that all windows will (currenty) always have an odd number of words, and the reason for this is the conditioned co-occurrence described below.
#
# The computation is done by first creating a (streamed) windowed corpus, consisting of all windows. From this corpus a DTM (document-term-matrix) is created, giving counts for each word in each window. This DTM is then used to compute a TTM (term-term-matrix) simply by multiplying the DTM with a transposed version of itself.
#
# Also note that the process of generating windows currently ignores sentences, paragraphs etc.
#
# #### GUI elements
#
# | | Config element |  Description |
# | -- | :------------- | :------------- |
# | | Corpus type | Type of corpus, disabled since only text corpora are allowed in this notebook.
# | | Source corpus file | Select file (ZIP) or folder that contains the text documents.
# | | Output tag | String that will be prefix to result files. Only valid filename chars are allowed.
# | | Output folder | Target folder for result files.
# | | Part-of-speech groups | Groups of tags to include in DTM given corpus PoS-schema
# | | Filename fields | Specifies attribute values to be extracted from filenames
# | | Lemmatize | Use word's lemma (base form)
# | | To lower | Lowercase all words
# | | Only alphabetic | Filter out words that has at least one non-alphabetic character
# | | Only alphanumeric | Filter out words that has at least one non-alphanumeric character
# | | No stopwords | Remove common stopwords using NLTK language specific stopwords
# | | Extra stopwords | Additional stopwords to remove
# | | Create subfolder | Sore result in subfolder named `output tag` in `target folder`
# | | Context distance | Max allowed distance to window's center-most word
# | | Concept | If specified, filter out windows having a center-most word not in list of specified words
# | | Remove concept | If specified, filter out concept word's co-occurrence pairs
# | | Normalize | Normalize output based on selected time period's corpus size
# | | Smooth | Smooth curve using PCHIP interpolations.
#
#
# N.B. Note that PoS schema (e.g. SUC, Universal, ON5 Penn Treebank tag sets) and language must be set for each corpus. This, and other options, is specified in the _corpus configuration file_. For an example, please see _SSI.yml_ inf the `resources` folder.
#
#
# ### Concept co-occurrence
#
# The algorithm allows for computing a conditioned co-occurrence, where the set of windows are constrained so that the center-most word must one of a number of specified (concept) words. This results in a set of co-occurrences that occur in close proximity (i.e. the max distance of D) of the center-most word.
#
# ### Word trends
#
# Specifiy words of interest in the textbox in the text box. You can use both __wildcards__ ```*``` and __regular expressions__ to widen your search. The
# words in the vocabulary that matches what you have specified will be listed in the selection box. Since using wildcards and regexps can result
# in a large number of words, only the `Word count` most frequent words are displayed. Refine your search if you get to many matches.
#
# The words are plotted when selected in the selection box. You can select and plot __multiple words__ by pressing CTRL, or using CTRL + arrow keys. The words are listed  in descending order by global corpus frequency.
#
# The regular expressions must be surrounded by vertical bars ```|```. To find words ending with ```tion```
# you can enter ```|.*tion$|```  The vertical
# bars is specified only so that the system can distinguish the regexp from normal words. The actual expression is ```^.*tion$```.
# The dot and star ```.*``` matches any character (the dot) any number of times (the ```*```). The dollar sign ```$``` indicates the word ending.
# So this expression matches all words that begins with any number of characters follwoed, by the character sequence ```tion``` at the end of the word.
# To match all words starting with `info`you can enter ```|^info.*|``` where ```^``` specifies the start of the word.
#
# The "words" in this case are co-occurrence pairs and to find instances matching "information" you could enter ```information*```, ```*information``` or ```*information*``` to match pairs starting with information, ending with information or containing information respectively.
