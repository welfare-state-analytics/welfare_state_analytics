    "A χ2 goodness-of-fit test is used to determine how (un)likely a data serie (i.e. the word's distribution over time) has been generate by a (discrete) uniform distribution. The actual word counts for each year are used since χ2 is not applicable to relative frequencies. As a rule of thumb, χ2 test requires each individual value to be greater or equal to 5.\n",

    "*If you have not only the frequencies but the actual counts, you can use a χ2 goodness-of-fit test for each data series. In particular, you wish to use the test for a discrete uniform distribution. This gives you a good test, which allows you to find out which data series are likely not to have been generated by a uniform distribution, but does not provide a measure of uniformity..... (I guess that the chi-squared statistic can be seen as a measure of uniformity, but it has some drawbacks, such as the lack of convergence, dependence on the arbitrarily placed bins, that the number of expected counts in the cells needs to be sufficiently large, etc. Which measure/test to use is a matter of taste though, and entropy is not without its problems either (in particular, there are many different estimators of the entropy of a distribution). To me, entropy seems like a less arbitrary measure and is easier to interpret.)*\n",

The lower bound 1d√ corresponds to uniformity and upper bound to the 1-hot vector. To scale this to a score between 0 and 1, you can use n∗d√−1d√−1, where n is the L2 norm.\n",
