    "document-term matrix (DTM) that are the basis for the word trend exploration.\n",
    "\n",
    "For large corpora the DTM processing time can be considerable and in such a case you\n",
    "should consider using the CLI-version of the processing pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the computed DTM is saved on disk in the specified folder. You must enter a\n",
    "tag that will be used when naming the (principal) result data file. This file will be named\n",
    "\"tag + `_vectorized_data.pickle`\" and will be used to uniquely identify the bundle of files that makes\n",
    "up the result. Note that if the `tag` already exists in the specified target folder then it will\n",
    "be overwritten. You can use the tag to describe the arguments of the computation i.e. PoS tags etc. If the `Create folder` option is checked, then the result bundle will be stored in a subfolder of the target folder named _tag_.\n",

    "you can enter `|.*tion$|` in the textbox. I might seem cryptical, but is a very powerful notation for searching words. The vertical\n",
    "bars is specified only so that the system can distinguish the regexp from \"normal\" words. The actual expression is `^.*tion$`.\n",
    "The dot and star`.*` matches any character (the dot) any number of times (the `*`). The dollar sign `$` indicates the word ending.\n",
